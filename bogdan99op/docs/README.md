SOLID Principles

Even though the acronym was introduced in 2004,the SOLID principles are a subset of more principles promoted by Robert Martin in 2000.
SOLID stands for:
1.the Single-responsibility principle states that no class should have more than one responsibility.
2.Open-closed principle argues that all software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3.the Liskoc substitution principle stands for functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.
4.the Interface segregation principle enforces that many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
5.Dependency inversion principle states that the project should depend on abstractions,noot concretions.
